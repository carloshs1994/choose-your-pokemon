# Hi there 👋🏻 

Thanks for taking the time to review the project. Here are some things important to note about it:

## Sass

The project was built using Sass. The only difference was that I needed to add an additional loader to webpack, but the result is overall the same (A CSS output). Additionally, I used ```MiniCssExtractPlugin``` to generate an external CSS file in the dist folder instead of the styles in the head of the document. It has the same dynamic response, it's just that the output looks more organized.

## Now into the project...

### Changes implemented in "list-structure" branch 

- ✅  My code follows the style guidelines of this project.

## Final notes

Is expected that this project meets the requirements. Please let me know if anything is left to be done or can be improved. Again, thanks for the review.
